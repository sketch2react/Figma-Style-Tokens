# Getting Started with Figma Style Tokens

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

This will transform the Figma Style Tokens data into Style Dictionary format and then compile the project's sass into css.

## See index.html for output example

# Please note

You need to have a Rapid API key from rapidapi.com, otherwise you will be unable to fetch data from our api. You can ofc use the mocked api response included in this project.

You need to create a .env file at the root of the project. In this file you need to add a variable named YOUR_RAPID_API_KEY and your Rapid API key. E.g.

YOUR_RAPID_API_KEY=the-api-key-you-get-from-Rapid API
